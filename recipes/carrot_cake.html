        <h3>How To Make Carrot Cake</h3>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
        <h4>What's In Carrot Cake?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugars</strong>
                : You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>
                : A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>
                : Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>
            : Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>
                : All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>
            : Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong>
                : Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>
            : Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrots</strong>
                : Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><strong>Pecans</strong>
            : Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
        </ul>

            Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade carrot cake:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the batter</strong>
                : Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cake</strong>
                : Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li><strong>Forst the cake</strong>
                : Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
